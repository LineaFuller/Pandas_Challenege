# Pandas Challenege
Analyzed data for an independent gaming company's most recent game Heroes of Pymoli. I produced a detailed report from the game's purchasing data into strategic insight.   

# Conclusions from my Data Report 

1. The majority of active players are male who also contribute to the majority of the total purchase revenue. 
2. The largest proportion of players are found within the age range of 20-24 and constitute 44% of the total amount of players. 
3. Players within the 35-39 age range spende more than other age ranges indicated by the group's high total purchases per person.
