# Pandas Challenege
Analyzed data for an independent gaming company's most recent game Heroes of Pymoli. I produced a detailed report from the game's purchasing data history and turned it into strategic insight.

### Purchasing Analysis based on Age, 

### Top Spenders

### Most Popular Items

### Most Profitable Items


  # Conclusions from my Data Report 
  
According to my findings...

1. More than three-quarters of the active players are male and contribute the majority of the total purchase revenue. 
2. The largest proportion of players are found within the age range of 20-24 and constitute 44% of the total amount of players. 
3. Players within the 35-39 age range have the highest purchase total indicating that they spend the most compared to the rest of the age groups.
